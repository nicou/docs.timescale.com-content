# Tutorial: Use TimescaleDB to Store Prometheus Metrics Data


This page used to contain a tutorial for storing Prometheus data in
TimescaleDB. We are now in the process of re-designing our 
prometheus-timescaledb integration and so have taken down our old
tutorial.

If you are interested in learning more about why we decided to re-design
our integration, check out our [design doc][design-doc] or our 
[github project][github-project].

Please check back here for an updated tutorial soon.
